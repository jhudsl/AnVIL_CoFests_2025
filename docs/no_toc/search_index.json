AnVIL Collection", " AnVIL CoFests! 2025 August 27, 2025 What are CoFests!? CollaborationFests!, also known as CoFests! (and sometimes as “hackathons”), are collaborative work events where we expand and improve the AnVIL community and the AnVIL ecosystem. Sometimes these gatherings are focused on AnVIL, and sometimes they are part of larger communities. Modified from https://galaxyproject.org/events/cofests What’s in a name: CollaborationFests! and Hackathons We collaborate. AnVIL collaborative events are emphatically called CollaborationFests! rather than Hackathons. Putting Collaboration in the name emphasizes what the events are about for us, and Fest communicates that they are fun events (which they are). “Hackathon” implies an emphasis on code. CoFests! are about contributing and learning how to contribute to all aspects of AnVIL, including training material, community infrastructure, documentation, unit tests, bug reports, and yes, even code. First and foremost AnVIL CoFests! are about growing the community of future contributors.

Goals Logistics Final Product / Report Out", " Organizer Guide The second AnVIL Community Conference (ACC) 2025 will take place on September 4-5, 2025 in Nashville, TN. Overall, ACC 2025 is a key event for professionals in the genomics community interested in biomedical and genomic cloud computing and features keynotes, town halls, CoFests! and other such component events. CoFests! provide attendees the opportunity to get some hands-on experience with AnVIL and foster connections within the AnVIL community. CoFests! Goals Build an inclusive community that is supportive of newcomers Collaborate and contribute to open science Produce a final product that accomplishes one of the following for a topic Makes useful forward progress Identifies opportunities and boundaries or limitations Logistics 3 Parallel tracks, 2.5 hrs each Sept 4 AnVIL 101 Polygenic Risk Score Analysis (title TBD) Reproducible Analysis on AnVIL (title TBD) Scientific Lead and AnVIL Outreach coordinator for support We expect 4-10 participants per track Note that a virtual option for AnVIL 101 will be offered on Sept 2 prior to ACC 2025. Prior to the CoFests, the scientific lead and AnVIL Outreach coordinators will work together to enumerate some ideas for final products and post them publicly in this book. The AnVIL Outreach coordinator will help add content to this guide, onboard newer AnVIL users to the platform, and provide guidance on the final product / report out. Final Product / Report Out The final product of CoFests doesn’t need to be code! These Collaboration Fests can support story-boarding future work or development of documentation or training materials. If it’s something that will help the community and make progress on an AnVIL associated topic and there’s sufficient interest, the idea is game! As Galaxy phrased it for their CoFests: [The goal of collaboration fests is to expand the ecosystem] Not just the code, but the whole ecosystem. That includes training, tools, best practice workflows, documentation, test cases, translations, infrastructure, and yes, even code. It helps us a lot if you can fill out some basic Report Out details. At the end of the session, your track will share a final report during the CoFest Recap Session! Task Time &amp; Lead Problem statement. Provide background info on the track’s overall topic and may include a brief summary of the pre-worked collaboration ideas. 15-20 minutes (Scientific Lead) Brainstorming. What project will the track tackle? Focus on understanding the participant backgrounds and skills and matching those with track ideas and actionable tasks to accomplish the goal. 5-10 minutes (Both) Onboarding. Handle billing accounts and other logistics necessary to accomplish the work. 5-10 minutes (AnVIL Outreach coordinator) Work Formal collaboration work time). 1.25-1.75 hours (N/A) Construct a “report out”. The report out may be a Google doc, Google slides, a GitHub repository, a website, an OTTR book, etc. 15-30 minutes (AnVIL Outreach coordinator) "],["anvil-101.html", "Chapter 1 AnVIL 101 1.1 About 1.2 Workspace", " Chapter 1 AnVIL 101 Led by: Ava Hoffman, Fred Hutch Cancer Center AnVIL Outreach coordinator: TBA 1.1 About This track will consist of both an overview and a hands-on workshop to provide individuals with Participants are not required to supply their own data, as publicly available data and an AnVIL workspace will be provided as part of the CoFest track. 1.2 Workspace The workspace for this track can be found at "],["polygenic-risk-score-prs-mix-analysis-in-anvil.html", "Chapter 2 Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Mix Analysis in AnVIL 2.1 About", " Chapter 2 Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Mix Analysis in AnVIL Led by: Matthew Lebo, PhD and Shruti Parpattedar 2.1 About This track, run by the AnVIL Clinical Resource team, will consist of both an overview and a hands-on workshop to provide individuals with an understanding of polygenic scores and how to run and evaluate them in AnVIL. First, we will level-set by providing an overview of the current state of polygenic analysis, with a focus on polygenic risk scores (PRS) and PRS Mix scores. Next, we will jointly work with participants to run PRS analyses in AnVIL using the WDL framework. These tasks will cover various components of the PRS mix workflow, with the goal of enabling users to import, set up and run the WDL on their own. We will also engage with participants to get feedback and create user-friendly documents to enable processing of this workflow once published to the broader community. Participants are not required to supply their own data, as publicly available data and an AnVIL workspace will be provided as part of the CoFest track. Users who are interested in running the analyses on their own data are welcome, but should have their own workspace in which to run the analyses.
